<center><h2 style="color: rgb(215, 255, 255);"><u>Theatre Kid Since Birth</u></h2></center>

<center><p style="color: #fffcfc;border: 2px solid rgb(15, 15, 159); padding: 5px;">
    Laufey has mentioned in her interviews that she grew up 
    watching a loving Golden age musicals such as 
    <i>Carousel, The Sound of Music, Oaklahoma!, 
    Singing in the Rain</i>, and <i>An American in Paris</i>. 
    She witnessed and felt that those movies "were so 
    beautiful and had these dance breaks and the dresses were
    floating and the colors â€“ that feeling I got from that, I just wanted to
    create that feeling." The influences of those childhood sounds and visuals flow through
    her music and gives a sense of romance and whimsy every time. 
    It makes something loved by <u>some</u> enjoyable for <b>many</b>!
</p></center>

<center><h2 style="color: rgb(215, 255, 255);"><u>A New Sound</u></h2></center>

<center><p style="color: #fffcfc;border: 2px solid rgb(15, 15, 159); padding: 5px;">
Laufey's music is a blend of the jazz, pop, and classical melodies found in 
musical culture. With her rich alto voice and majestic yet catchy melodies, her songs
are a mix of authentic feeling and intention. The cocktail of familiar genres of music 
allow it to feel nostalgic and cozy, but with twists and lyrics that sink in and stand
out from other artists of the era.
</p>
</center>

<center><h2 style="color: rgb(215, 255, 255);"><u>She's <i>Too</i> Relatable I Fear</u></h2></center>

<center><p style="color:#fffcfc;border: 2px solid rgb(15, 15, 159); padding: 5px;">
A lot of the lyrics in Laufey's songs are catchy- 
but veerrrrry easy to relate to as well. The themes and topics that 
she covers may be on the heavier end- 
but the airy melodies stay in your head for <i>days</i>. She finds the 
universal topics of love, moving on, nostalgia, self-dicovery and 
vulnerability and weaves them into her own perspectives. Her song <i>Falling 
Behind</i>, for example, talk about the stuggle to find solidarity
with others-and in life in general. Some of these lyrics are:<br>
<br>
</p></center>

<p style="color:lemonchiffon;">"<i>The sun's engaged to the sky <br>
And my best friend's found a new guy<br>
I'm only getting older<br>
I've never had a shoulder to cry on<br>
Someone to call mine<br>
Everybody's falling in love and I'm falling behind</i>"<br>
<br>
</p>

<p style="color: #fffcfc;border: 2px solid rgb(15, 15, 159); padding: 5px;"> 
The sense of wating someone to depend on (not just in the 
romantic sense) and feeling like a late bloomer on a lot of life's big 
and wonderful moments is something I think many have experienced. 
 <br>
 <br>
In her song <i>Letter To My 13 Year Old Self</i>, Laufey writes about 
the challanges-and even better rewards- that life will bring to her. 
This song emulates the feeling of confidence and pride wrapped in a warm
hug- of being able to look back at all you have done, and see how far 
you've pushed foward, like in these verses:
</p>

<p style="color: lemonchiffon;">"<i>You'll grow up<br>
And grow so confident, and<br>
Write your story, fall in love a little too<br>
The things you thought you'd never do<br>
I wish I could go back and give her a squeeze<br>
Myself at thirteen<br>
And just let her know, know that she's beautiful</i>"<br>
<br>
</p>

<center><h2 style="color: rgb(215, 255, 255);"><u>A Multi-Instumentalist To Boot!</u></h2></center>

<center><p style="color:#fffcfc; border: 2px solid rgb(15, 15, 159); padding: 5px;">Laufey is known for playing instruments 
such as the Cello, Piano, and Guitar. (For many instrumental majors, 
this might seem like light-work). For me, though, those are such hard 
and beautiful instruemnts to learn, and she always finds time to place
those intruments in her songs. Having so much talent yet staying so really connect to what and who I 
aspire to learn to become. The sucess that she has inspires others to trust
the part of them that allows them to be comfortable with who they are, 
and who they wish to see themsleves become. It shows all who listen to her songs that <b><u>no</u></b> dream is out of reach.
