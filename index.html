<center><h2 style="color: rgb(215, 255, 255);"><u>Theatre Kid Since Birth</u></h2></center>
<p style="color: #fffcfc;">
    Laufey has mentioned in her inteerviews that she grew up 
    watching a loving Golden age musicals such as 
    <i>Carousel, The Sound of Music, Oaklahoma!, 
    Singing in the Rain</i>, and <i>An American in Paris</i>. 
    She witnessed and felt that those movies "were so 
    beautiful and had these dance breaks and the dresses were
    floating and the colors â€“ that feeling I got from that, I just wanted to
    create that feeling." The influences of those childhood sounds flows through
    her music and gives a sense of romance and whimsy every time. 
    It makes something loved by <u>some</u> enjoyable for <b>many</b>!
</p>

<center><h2 style="color: rgb(215, 255, 255);"><u>A New Sound</u></h2></center>
<p style="color: #fffcfc;">
Laufey's music is a blend of the jazz, pop, and classical melodies found in 
musical culture. With her rich alto voice and solemn yet catchy melodies, her songs
are a mix of authentic feeling and intention. The cocktail of familiar gnres of music 
allow it to feel nostalgic and cozy, but with twists and lyrics that allow it to stand
out from ofthr artists of the era.
</p>

<center><h2 style="color: rgb(215, 255, 255);"><u>She's <i>Too</i> Relatable I Fear</u></h2></center>
<p style="color:#fffcfc;">
A lot of the lyrics in Laufey's songs are catchy- 
but veerrrrry easy to relate to as well. Her song <i>Falling 
Behind</i>, for example, talk about the stuggle to find solidarity
with others-and in life in general. Some of these lyrics are:<br>
<br>
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(255, 232, 158);">"<i>The sun's engaged to the sky <br>
And my best friend's found a new guy<br>
I'm only getting older<br>
I've never had a shoulder to cry on<br>
Someone to call mine<br>
Everybody's falling in love and I'm falling behind</i>"<br>
<br>
</p>
<p> style="color: #fffcfc;">" 
<p>The sense of wating someone to depend on (not just in the 
romantic sense) and feeling like a late bloomer on a lot of life's big 
and wonderful moments is something I feel like many have experienced if 
not currently. 
</p>

<center><h2 style="color: rgb(215, 255, 255);"><u>A Multi-Instumentalist To Boot!</u></h2></center>

<p style="color:#fffcfc;">Laufey is known for playing instruments 
such as the Cello, Piano, and Guitar. (For many instrumental majors, 
this might seem like light-work). For me, though, those are such hard 
and beautiful instruemnts to learn, and she always finds time to place
those intruments in her songs. Her talents really connect to what I 
aspire to learn and be.
