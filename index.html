<h2 style="color: rgb(215, 255, 255);"><u>Theatre Kid Since Birth</u></h2>
<p style="color: rgb(255, 245, 186);">
    Laufey has mentioned in her inteerviews that she grew up 
    watching a loving Golden age musicals such as 
    <i>Carousel, The Sound of Music, Oaklahoma!, 
    Singing in the Rain</i>, and <i>An American in Paris</i>. 
    She witnessed and felt that those movies "were so 
    beautiful and had these dance breaks and the dresses were
    floating and the colors â€“ that feeling I got from that, I just wanted to
    create that feeling." The influences of those childhood sounds flows through
    her music and gives a sense of romance and whimsy every time. 
    It makes something loved by some enjoyable for many!

<h2 style="color: rgb(215, 255, 255);"><u>A Multi-Instumentalist To Boot!</u></h2>

<p style="color:rgb(255, 245, 186); ">Laufey is known for playing instruments 
such as the Cello, Piano, and Guitar. (For many instrumental majors, 
this might seem like light-work). For me, though, those are such hard 
and beautiful instruemnts to learn, and she always finds time to place
those intruments in her songs. Her talents really connect to what I 
aspire to learn and be.
